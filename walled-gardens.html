		<h1>Walled Gardens</h1>
		<p>
		Walled gardens are bad. That is all.
		</p>
		<p>
		Walled gardens require almost by definition a kind of gatekeeping. They
		also have a leveling effect of the population; you can only have a
		predetermined set of ideas and techneques. This is very boring.
		Finally, once you are in them you cannot easily move out of them. Very
		annoying.
		</p>
		<p>
		Walled gardens have some use, as far as communities, but should be
		avoided in regards to technology.
