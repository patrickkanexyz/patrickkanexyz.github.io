		<h1>Keeping Your YouTube Downloader Updated</h1>
		<p>
		If you are not on a rolling release distro and are having a hard time
		keeping yt-dlp or other youtube-dl fork up to date then I have the
		solution.
		</p>
		<p>
		For this guide I'm using <pre>yt-dlp</pre>. First check your path with
		<pre>echo $PATH</pre>. Most distros will have <pre>~/.local/bin</pre>
		at or near the top; above <pre>/usr/bin</pre> or whatever other path
		that <pre>yt-dlp</pre> was installed in. If you don't have
		<pre>~/.local/bin</pre> then make it. Then go to the
		<a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases">yt-dlp releases</a>
		and the the executable for your OS. Put that executable in your 
		<pre>~/.local/bin</pre> directory.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now when mpv looks for the yt-dlp executable it will check each
		directory in your path starting with your <pre>~/.local/bin</pre>
		directory with the new yt-dlp executable. Problem solved.
		</p>
		<p>
		If your executable gets out of date just grab the new one and put it
		in <pre>~/.local/bin</pre>.
