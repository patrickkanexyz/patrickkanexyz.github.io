		<h1>Keeping Your YouTube Downloader Updated</h1>
		<p>
		If you are not on a rolling release distro and are having a hard time
		keeping yt-dlp or other youtube-dl fork up to date then I have the
		solution.
		</p>
		<p>
		For this guide I'm using <b>yt-dlp</b>. First check your path with
		<b>echo $PATH</b>. Most distros will have <b>~/.local/bin</b>
		at or near the top; above <b>/usr/bin</b> or whatever other path
		that <b>yt-dlp</b> was installed in. If you don't have
		<b>~/.local/bin</b> then make it. Then go to the
		<a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases">yt-dlp releases</a>
		and the the executable for your OS. Put that executable in your 
		<b>~/.local/bin</b> directory.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now when mpv looks for the yt-dlp executable it will check each
		directory in your path starting with your <b>~/.local/bin</b>
		directory with the new yt-dlp executable. Problem solved.
		</p>
		<p>
		If your executable gets out of date just grab the new one and put it
		in <b>~/.local/bin</b>.
