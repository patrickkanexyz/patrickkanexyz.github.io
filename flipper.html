		<h1>On The Flipper Zero</h1>
		<p>
		I've had a flipper for some time now. When I first got it I played
		around with it, cloned some gate fobs, messed with turning peoples'
		TV's on and off, and that was about it.
		</p>
		<p>Then I started looking into what other apps I could run on the
		flipper. Browsing the 'app store' it looked like mostly games and 
		largely useless utilities.
		</p>
		<p>
		This initial impression of the flipper left me disapointed by the
		flipper, writing it off as a nerd toy for Redditors. But, then I found
		out about UART and that has caused me to take another look at the flip.
		The rest of this page will detail the useful and interesting things I 
		find to do with my flipper.
