		<h1>Configuration Constipation or Why Vi Instead of (Neo)Vim</h1>
		<p>
		Some time ago I coined the term 'configuration constipation' while
		talking about computers and ricing. I used this term to refer to how I
		would get stuck wasting lots of time configuring programs in a way that
		didn't really get me any more practical use out of them.  This was most
		apparent to me with regard to Vim.
		</p>

		<h2>Vim, An Into To Bloat</h2>
		<p>
		Vim is usually billed as a minimalistic, extensable text editor. On
		inspection, only one of these claims appears to be true. Vim is very
		extensable, but it is not minimalistic, as can be seen in size of the
		source code, increasing number of features, and the fact that 'vim-tiny'
		exists.
		</p>
		<p>
		This large codebase comes with feature creep. I see this as a problem
		because the extra features, even if you are not currently using them, 
		server to draw your attention. This comes in the form of reading the
		manuals and adding to your configuration. This is how people end up
		with 500 line vimrc files. Those 500 lines are also going to need to be
		kept up to date, which takes time. And, they will be the cause of many
		hours of tinkering, usually with only minor improvments.
		</p>
		<p>
		Next is the issue of extensablity. Extensablity can be a good thing,
		but Vim's extensiablity these days tends to come in the worst form,
		the plug-in.
		</p>
		<p>
		Plug-in like extensability brings with it more configuration problems.
		First, a plugin manager must be used, and configured. That takes time.
		Next, plugins must be found, installed, and configured. More time.
		And because of the nature of most plugin ecosystems, they will radically
		change every few months with the ebb and flow of what is trendy. This
		leads to the configuration constipation problem multiplying both in
		scope and in time.
