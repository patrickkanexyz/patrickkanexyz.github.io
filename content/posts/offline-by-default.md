Having a high speed internet connection by default is very convenent, but does
it come at the cost of productivity? Yes.

<!--more-->

- Having access to the internet opens me up to distractions.

- I have to force myself to not look at Youtube and other 'doom scrolling'
sites.

- Encourages me to 'just Google it', instead of trying to think through a
solution. This saves time on trivial tasks, and is good when you just need to
know 'factoids', but hurts my ability to think critically.

- Contributes to and excess of inputs and deficite of outputs.

By being offline by default it limits destractions and makes my use of the
internet more intensional.
