An intro to the blog and about starting things in general.

<!--more-->

It's important to start things that you want to start, today. Don't put things
of until you feel "inspired". Once you decide to start something make the most
basic plan to get it done. Everyday make sure to do at least *one* thing to
move to get whatever that thing is done. 

This idea is sometimes called "chaining". You can think of each day you work
on something as adding a link to a chain. Some people will make drawings of 
chains, adding a link each day they work on their project. This can also be
applied to forming or breaking a habbit. The github contribution graph can be
used as a digital form of this chaining drawing (this is what I am doing).

Anyway, this blog is part of my chaining routine and also a commonplace for me
to record solutions to problems I encounter while programming and doing 
computer things in general.
